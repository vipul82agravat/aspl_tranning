PHP -FPM

    PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) dramatically speeds up the performance of your PHP environment.

    -PHP-FPM is the most popular alternative implementation of PHP FastCGI. It has additional features which are really useful for high-traffic websites

    -Advanced management that enables to easily stop/start processes.
    -Emergency restart in case of accidental destruction of the opcode cache.
    -Accelerated support for uploads.
    -Slowlog variable configuration; to detect which functions take a longer time to execute than usual.
    -Based on php.ini configuration files.
    -FastCGI improvements, as fastcgi_finish_request(); a special function to stop and download all data while you keep doing a longer process


    Nginx and PHP-FPM: a perfect match

        -Nginx, as a stable high-performance web server and with a very low consumption of resources, is the perfect match for PHP-FPM. Nginx has an asynchronous architecture that is much more scalable, based on events


    Configure PHP-FPM with NGINX

        PHP-FPM NGINX Configuration Prerequisites
            -You can open a SSH session to your Ubuntu
            -You have already installed NGINX and PHP in your Ubuntu

       NGINX PHP-FPM Configuration Steps

        -Install PHP-FPM
            - apt-get install php8.1-fpm
        -check the status
          - systemctl status php8.1-fpm

       Configure PHP-FPM Pool
        -

      Configure NGINX for PHP-FPM
        -Now create an NGINX server block that will make use of the above FPM pool. To do that, edit your NGINX configuration file and pass the path of pool’s socket file using the option fastcgi_pass inside location block for php.

        How to Configure PHP-FPM with NGINX

        Now create an NGINX server block that will make use of the above FPM pool. To do that, edit your NGINX configuration file and pass the path of pool’s socket file using the option fastcgi_pass inside location block for php.

        location ~ \.php$ {
            fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php7.2-fpm-wordpress-site.sock;
            fastcgi_index index.php;
            include fastcgi.conf;
    }



    pool
        -Each site is also deployed with a PHP-FPM resource pool, which is owned by the site user. This prevents PHP scripts from reading or modifying files outside of the current site’s root directory. Meaning, if a malicious user were to gain access to a site on your server, they would be unable to infect other sites.

        -The system creates a pool when the /var/cpanel/userdata/[user]/[domain].php_fpm.yaml configuration file exists in the domain. This file must include the following lines:

        _is_present: 1


        create a pool

        -To create a pool, run the Cpanel::PHPFPM::rebuild_files() function.

        You may also run the /scripts/php_fpm_config --rebuild script to create a pool.

        The system scans for the /var/cpanel/ApachePHPFPM/system.yaml and /var/cpanel/ApachePHPFPM/system_pool_defaults.yaml files and then generates a system configuration for each of the PHP versions.

        -The system searches for the domain’s yaml files.
