constant
    constant checks if a variable has the exact same value as a constant. You can use either global constants or class constants

    {% if post.status is constant('Post::PUBLISHED') %}
    the status attribute is exactly the same as Post::PUBLISHED
    {% endif %}

 defined

    defined checks if a variable is defined in the current context. This is very useful if you use the strict_variables option:
    {% if foo is defined %}
    ...
    {% endif %}

    divisible by

        divisible by checks if a variable is divisible by a number:

        {% if loop.index is divisible by(3) %}
            ...
        {% endif %}

     empty
        empty checks if a variable is an empty string, an empty array, an empty hash, exactly false, or exactly null.

            {% if foo is empty %}
                ...
            {% endif %}

       even
            even returns true if the given number is even:

            {{ var is even }}


        iterable
            iterable checks if a variable is an array or a traversable object:

            {% if users is iterable %}


            null
                null returns true if the variable is null:
                {{ var is null }}

         same as
            same as checks if a variable is the same as another variable. This is equivalent to === in
            {% if foo.attribute is same as(false) %}
