What is JavaScript?

-Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most
commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side
script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages.



    -JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
    -Designed for creating network-centric applications.
    -Complementary to and integrated with Java.
    -Complementary to and integrated with HTML.
    -Open and cross-platform.



    Client-Side JavaScript

        -It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content


     Advantages of JavaScrip

        -Less server interaction
        -Immediate feedback to the visitors:
        -Increased interactivity:
        -Richer interfaces

    Limitations of JavaScrip
        --Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has   been kept for security reason.
        -JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available
        -JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocessor capabilities

            JAVASCRIPT – SYNTAX


                -JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the <script>... </script> HTML tags in a web page.
                -You can place the <script> tags, containing your JavaScript, anywhere within you web page, but it is normally recommended that you should keep it within the <head>tags.


                    <script ...>
                    JavaScript code
                    </script>

                        -Language: This attribute specifies what scripting language you are using.
                            Typically, its value will be javascript. Although recent versions of HTML (and
                            XHTML, its successor) have phased out the use of this attribute.
                        -Type: This attribute is what is now recommended to indicate the scripting
                        language in use and its value should be set to "text/javascrip


                        <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
                            JavaScript code
                        </script>


            Your First JavaScriptCode
                    The comment ends with a "//-->".

                    -we call a function document.write which writes a string into our HTML document.
                    example
                        <html>
                        <body>
                        <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
                        <!--
                        document.write ("Hello World!")
                        //-->
                        </script>
                        </body>
                        </html>


             Whitespace and Line Breaks
                ignore it

            Semicolons are Optional

            var1 = 10; var2 = 20; (RIGHT)
            var1 = 10 var2 = 20


           Case Sensitivity

                    JavaScript is a case-sensitive language.

            Comments in JavaScript

                -Any text between the characters /* and */ is treated as a comment
                - JavaScript also recognizes the HTML comment opening sequence <!--.
                    JavaScript treats this as a single-line comment, just as it does the // comment.
                     The HTML comment closing sequence --> is not recognized by JavaScript so it
                    should be written as //-->.
                <!--
                // This is a comment. It is similar to comments in C++
                /*
                * This is a multiline comment in JavaScript
                * It is very similar to comments in C Programming
                */
                //-->




    -JAVASCRIPT – ENABLING
                Click the Chrome menu at the top right hand corner of your browser.
                 Select Settings.
                 Click Show advanced settings at the end of the page.
                 Under the Privacy section, click the Content settings button.
                 In the "Javascript" section, select "Do not allow any site to run JavaScript"
                or "Allow all sites to run JavaScript (recommended)".


    JAVASCRIPT – PLACEMENT

            Script in <head>...</head> section.
             Script in <body>...</body> section.
             Script in <body>...</body> and <head>...</head> sections.


            EXAMPLE

                <html>
                <head>
                <script type="text/javascript">
                <!--
                function sayHello() {
                alert("Hello World")
                }
                //-->
                </script>
                </head>
                <body>
                Click here for the result
                <input type="button" onclick="sayHello()" value="Say Hello" />





    JavaScript in External File

        -file and then include it into your HTML files.

        -Here is an example to show how you can include an external JavaScript file in your HTML code using script tag and its src attribute.
        -<script type="text/javascript" src="filename.js" ></script>

        For example, you can keep the following content in filename.js file and then you can use sayHello function in your HTML file after including the filename.js file.

        function sayHello() {
        alert("Hello World")
        }


    JAVASCRIPT – VARIABLES
        -JavaScript Datatypes
            -One of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the set of data types it supports
            -JavaScript allows you to work with three primitive data types:
                Numbers, e.g., 123, 120.50 etc.

                Strings of text, e.g. "This text string" etc.

                 Boolean, e.g. true or false.

      JavaScript Variables

        -Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the var keyword as follows.
        -var money;
        -o declare multiple variables with the same var keyword as follows:
        -vat ne,two;

        -Storing a value in a variable is called variable initialization


-JavaScript Variable Scope
        -Global Variables
        -Local Variables:

        Global Variables: A global variable has global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.

         Local Variables: A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.


            var myVar = "global";
                // Declare a global variable

            function checkscope( ) {
            var myVar = "local";
            // Declare a local variable
            document.write(myVar);
            }
    JavaScript Variable Names

        -JavaScript variable names should not start with a numeral (0-9). T
        -begin with a letter or an underscore character
        -JavaScript variable names are case-sensitive. For example, Name and name are two different variable

  JavaScript Reserved Words

        A list of all the reserved words in JavaScript are given in the following table. They
cannot be used as JavaScript variables, functions, methods, loop labels, or any object
names.

           6.JAVASCRIPT – OPERATORS

           -Let us take a simple expression 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here 4 and 5 are called operands and ‘+’ is called the operator.

            Arithmetic Operators (+,-,*,/,%,++,--)
             Comparison Operators (==,!=,>,<,<=,>=)
             Logical (or Relational) Operators (&&,||,!,)
             Assignment Operators(=,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=)
             Conditional (or ternary) Operators(?)



            typeof Operator
                The typeof operator is a unary operator that is placed before its single operand, which can be of any type. Its value is a string indicating the data type of the operand.
                Number,
                String,
                Boolean,
                Object,
                Function,
                Undefined,
                Null,
