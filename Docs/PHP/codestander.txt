PSR-1: Basic Coding Standard

        This section of the standard comprises what should be considered the standard coding elements that are required to ensure a high level of technical interoperability between shared PHP code.

        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

            -Files MUST use only <?php and <?= tags.
            -Files MUST use only UTF-8 without BOM for PHP code.
            -Files SHOULD either declare symbols (classes, functions, constants, etc.) or cause side-effects (e.g. generate output, change .ini settings, etc.) but SHOULD NOT do both.
            -Namespaces and classes MUST follow an "autoloading" PSR: [PSR-0, PSR-4].
            -Class names MUST be declared in StudlyCaps.
            -Class constants MUST be declared in all upper case with underscore separators.
            -Method names MUST be declared in camelCase.


            Example
                <?php
                // side effect: change ini settings
                ini_set('error_reporting', E_ALL);

                // side effect: loads a file
                include "file.php";

                // side effect: generates output
                echo "<html>\n";

                // declaration
                function foo()
                {
                    // function body
                }


         Namespace and Class Names
            -This means each class is in a file by itself, and is in a namespace of at least one level: a top-level vendor name
            -Class names MUST be declared in StudlyCaps.


                <?php
                // PHP 5.3 and later:
                namespace Vendor\Model;

                class Foo
                {
                }

        Class Constants, Properties, and Methods

            -Class constants MUST be declared in all upper case with underscore separators


                <?php
                    namespace Vendor\Model;

                    class Foo
                    {
                        const VERSION = '1.0';
                        const DATE_APPROVED = '2012-06-01';
                    }
         Properties

            -This guide intentionally avoids any recommendation regarding the use of $StudlyCaps, $camelCase, or $under_score property names.


        Methods

            Method names MUST be declared in camelCase().
