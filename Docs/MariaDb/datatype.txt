DataType

    -data type that not only defines what data can be stored in the table column but also what influence it may have on database performance.
    -data types that are grouped in numeric (integer, float, boolean, etc.), date and time (DATETIME, DATE, etc.), string (CHAR, VARCHAR, etc.), spatial, and JSON


 Data Types in MySQL
        . Each column can contain only one data type. In MySQL, data types are grouped in different categories:

        Numeric
        Date and time
        String
        Spatial
        JSON


      MySQL String Data Types (Text Formats)


        -In MySQL, string data types usually store data as long strings of text
        -Strings can consist of letters, numbers, or binary media files such as images, photos, or audio files.


        The MySQL string data types are divided into:

          -TEXT
          -BLOB
          -CHAR and VARCHAR
          -BINARY and VARBINARY

          -ENUM
          -SET



          TEXT Data Type

              -The MySQL TEXT data type is used to store long-text strings to display information about the table object, such as product descriptions, blog comments.
              -The storage size of the TEXT data type varies from 1 byte to 4 GB.


               different TEXT data types: TINYTEXT, TEXT, MEDIUMTEXT, and LONGTEX

                TINYTEXT

                  - 255 storage
                  -To store short-text strings such as links, product description or summary

               TEXT
                  -max charter 65535

                  -To store texts such as articles that do not exceed the specified length of characters

              MEDIUMTEXT
                   -16 MB store max characters  16777215
                   -	To store large texts such as whitepapers or books

              LONGTEXT
                  -4 GB	storage max  4294967295
                  -To store huge texts such as computer programs or applications


          -BLOB Datatype in MySQL

            -the BLOB data types are binary strings.
            -MySQL, the BLOB data type represents a binary large object and can be used to store binary media data, such as audio or video links, images, or files.


            -The BLOB data types, including
                TINYBLOB,
                BLOB,
                MEDIUMBLOB, and
                LONGBLOB,
              have a variable length, i.e. additional bytes (from 1 to 4) are required to store a value length in the column.]

              TINYBLOB => 255 bytes + 1 byte

              BLOB => 65535 + 2 bytes

              MEDIUMBLOB => 16777215 + 3 bytes

              LONGBLOB => 4294967295 + 4 bytes

        -CHAR and VARCHAR data type
            -the CHAR data types store non-binary strings with a fixed length that reaches 255 characters,
            -while the VARCHAR data types store non-binary strings with a variable length having a maximum size of up to 65535 characters.
            -The main distinction between the CHAR and VARCHAR data types is a way of storing data
            -It should be noted that when defining a datatype for a phone number in MySQL, VARCHAR is more preferable to integers as sometimes there may be special symbols or characters. In addition, VARCHAR simplifies validation.

        -BINARY and VARBINARY Types

          Though CHAR and VARCHAR seem to be similar to BINARY and VARBINARY data types, they have some differences. BINARY and VARBINARY store binary strings, and length is measured in bytes.

       -ENUM Data Type in MySQL

          -The MySQL ENUM data types are strings with enumeration values.
          -ENUM allows you to set a list of predefined values and then choose any of them. If you add an invalid value that is not included in the list, you will get an empty string.

      -SET Data Type

            -The MySQL SET data types allow you to store zero or multiple values (separated by comma) you specified in a list of predefined values when creating a table.


       Diff Set and ENUM
        -An ENUM value must be one of those listed in the column definition, or the internal numeric equivalent thereof. The value cannot be the error value (that is, 0 or the empty string).
        -A SET value must be the empty string or a value consisting only of the values listed in the column definition separated by commas. For a column defined as SET('a','b','c'), values such as 'd' or 'a,b,c,d' are illegal and are rejected.
        -Enum and Set totally depends on requirements, like if you have a list of radio button where only one can be chosen at a time, use Enum. And if you have a list of checkbox where at a time more then one item can be chosen, use se



    MySQL Numeric Data Types (Number Formats)



        MySQL supports numeric data types such as integers, decimals, and floating-point data types:


          Integers represent numbers without fractions and can have SIGNED and UNSIGNED attributes. Usually, they may be used for IDs or counting numbers.
          Decimals represent numbers with fractions and store exact numeric values in the column. They can be signed and unsigned and are usually used for columns that store monetary values. In the comparison with the floating-point numbers, decimals are more accurate.
          Floating-point represent numbers with fractions but do not store exact numeric values. They can be signed and unsigned.


        Integer Data Types

          TINYINT
              -128  to 127
              -TINYINT is a very small integer. The minimum and maximum SIGNED values are -128 and 127 respectively, while for UNSIGNED values TINYINT range is from 0 to 255.
              -TINYINT uses 1 byte per row. It is the best option when you want to save space on your disk and enhance performance.
              Grade tinyint(4) UNSIGNED,

               VALUES (1, 'John', 'Smith', -5);

               we’ll get the error ‘Out of range value for column ‘Grade’ at row 12′.

          SMALLINT
            -32768 to 32767
            -SMALLINT is a small integer. The SMALLINT range for SIGNED values is from -32768 to 32767.
            -the minimum and maximum values for SMALLINT UNSIGNED are 0 and 65535 respectively.
            -The size is 2 bytes per row

            value_2 smallint(6) UNSIGNED,

          INT
          -2147483648 to  2147483647
          MEDIUMINT

            -8388608 to 8388607

              MEDIUMINT is a medium-sized integer. T
              The minimum and maximum values for MEDIUMINT SIGNED are -8388608 and 8388607 respectively

              The range for minimum and maximum UNSIGNED values equals 0 and 16777215 respectively.

              size is 3 bytes per row.
          BIGINT

            -263 too 263-1
            BIGINT is a large integer.
            . The minimum and maximum values for SIGNED are – -263 and 263-1 respectively. The range for minimum and maximum values for UNSIGNED equals 0 and 264-1 respectively.
              value_2 bigint(20) UNSIGNED,


            https://blog.devart.com/mysql-int-data-type.html#what_is_mysql_integer


          UNSIGNED can store only zero and positive numbers in a column.


          SIGNED can allow zero, positive, and negative numbers. With the MySQL value as SIGNED, one bit is taken for the sign symbol as opposed to the unsigned ones, when they do not have signs preceding the value.


          When we set the MySQL INT UNSIGNED column, it means that negative values cannot be inserted in this column

          while the minimum one is 0.

          ex total_amount as the INT UNSIGNED data type.



       MySQL INT with the ZEROFILL attribute

        If you need to replace spaces with zeros, you can use the ZEROFILL attribute for the MySQL INT UNSIGNED column.
        For example, for the INT(3) ZEROFILL column with the value 1, the result you retrieve will be 001.
         weight int(2) ZEROFILL,

        review int(3) ZEROFILL,
        e: Keep in mind that UNSIGNED is automatically added to the numeric column.



   MySQL Date & Time Data Types


      MySQL Data Types: Full List with Examples (2023)

        DATE
          Stores only date information in the table column
          YYYY-MM-DD format (year, month, and date)
      TIME
        Displays only time
        HH:MM:SS format (hours, minutes, and seconds)
      DATETIME

        Stores both date and time in the column

        YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS ( year, month, and date, and hours, minutes, and seconds)

    TIMESTAMP

      stores both date and time values in the column. Conversion of the value from the zone of the connection server to UTC takes place.
      YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS ( year, month, and date, and hours, minutes, and seconds)
      -

    YEAR

      Stores only year values in the column


      YYYY (year)

    DATETIME and TIMESTAMP seem to be similar, though they have some differences. The DATETIME data type needs 4 bytes to store data, while the TIMESTAMP data type requires 8 bytes.

    Date and time

=====================================
  MySQL Spatial Data Types

      -Spatial data types store geometry and geography values in the table column
      -MySQL supports single geometry values (GEOMETRY, POINT, LINESTRING, POLYGON) and multiple values grouped in a set (MULTIPOINT, MULTILINESTRING, MULTIPOLYGON, and GEOMETRYCOLLECTION).

      GEOMETRY

        -Stores any type of the geometry value

      POINT

        -Stores a MySQL single X and Y coordinate value

      LINESTRING

        -Stores a set of points that form a curve

      POLYGON

        -Stores a set of points in the multisided geometry

      MULTIPOINT

        -Stores a set of multiple point values

      MULTILINESTRING

          -Stores a set of multiple LINESTRING values

      MULTIPOLYGON

        Stores a set of multiple POLYGON values
     GEOMETRYCOLLECTION
      Stores a set of multiple GEOMETRY values


JSON Data Type


    Starting with version 5.7.8, MySQL supports JSON data types that store JSON documents in the JSON column and provide access to document elements easily and quickly.

    the JSON format allows for a quick search of values within the document using a key or array index,
     turn, will improve overall performance and optimize storage.


Add clounm in table

  ALTER TABLE student_work
  ADD COLUMN work_data json;

  update records in table to add clounm

  UPDATE student_work

  SET
    work_data = '{ "name": "Google Chrome", "OS": "Windows", "resolution": {"x": 1920, "y": 1080} }'
  WHERE id = 1;
