Attributes  iid
BINARY
    -basically the same as a text with the binary attribute.
    The BINARY attribute in character column definitions has a different effect. A character column defined with the BINARY attribute is assigned the binary collation of the column's character set.

    CHAR(10) BINARY
    CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_bin
    Here MySQL performs a byte-by-byte comparison

UNSIGNED

    UNSIGNED is an optional attribute for integers in MySQL used to define only positive numbers
    Always use UNSIGNED to represent whole values that will never be negative.
    AUTO_INCREMENT that starts at 1 will never be negative.

    The main advantage of using this attribute is that MySQL will not allocate unnecessary space for negative numbers from -2147483648 to zero, and will double the space for positive numbers from zero to 4294967295


ZEROFILL
    The role of the ZEROFILL attribute is only to indicate to MySQL how the information should be shown.
    If you need to do a WHERE 0001=1, SQL will still work as expected.
    ZEROFILL is used to fill an integer with zeros so that all the numbers in the column have the same number of digits.
    As stated above, when a column has ZEROFILL it automatically has UNSIGNED checked.

    ALTER TABLE student_work
  ADD COLUMN complated_task int(5) ZEROFILL;


ZEROFILL and UNSIGNED

update on CURRENT_TIMESTAMP


    -An auto-updated column is automatically updated to the current timestamp when the value of any other column in the row is changed from its current value. An auto-updated column remains unchanged if all other columns are set to their current values.


    ALTER TABLE student_work
  ADD COLUMN update_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
                           DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
                           ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;




ALTER TABLE student_work
  ADD COLUMN create_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
                           DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
